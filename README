Homework: Programming Probability
Author: Chad Myles
Date: 10/4/2016

Problems Solved: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K and N.
All problems are solved quickly with the exception of
problem N which seemingly hit combinatorics (I ended its
execution after letting it run for roughly 2 hours.)

To compile/run:
Run:
	config.sh R	--to configure with rational arithmetic
	config.sh FP	--to configure with floating point arithmetic

Then to compile run:
	ghc Solutions.hs

In order to run, run:
	Solutions [args] --where args is the letters of the desired solutions

For example:
	Solutions A B C
will print the solutions to problems A, B, and C
